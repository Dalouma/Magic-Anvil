  - Greetins, smith. I am in search of equipment befitting of a protector in order
    to serve the goddess. What can you offer me?

  - Excellent! The goddess shall be pleased. With this I can protect the people while
    avoiding killing.
  - What do I owe you?
  acceptText:
  - I'm not too confident with what you presented me, but I shall accept this fine
    weapon.
  - How much?
  disappointText: []
  rejectText:
  - Preposterous! You've presented me with a coward's weapon. The church shall hear
    of this mockery.
